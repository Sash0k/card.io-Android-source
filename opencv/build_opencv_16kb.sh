# This is a script to build open cv with only the necesssary modules for card io with support for 16KB page size.
# The reason why we don't use the standard build_sdk.py that comes in the Open CV repository is that there seems to be no way to only build the .so files for the modules we want, resulting in the card io aar file becoming quite large.
#
# Follow the steps below:
# 1. Download OpenCV - https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases/tag/4.11.0 or later
# 2. Paste this script at the root folder of the repo
# 3. Install NDK 27 (easily done from Android Studio -> Tools -> SDK Manager -> SDK Tools -> Check "Show Package Details" in bottom right corner to be able to select a specific NDK version)
# 4. Set / Confirm the variables in the script
# 5. Add run permissions to the script - "chmod +x <file_name>"
# 6. Run this script.
# 7. .so files for each cpu Architecture will be located at build_opencv_so_files. Just copy and paste them to card-io repository - "card.io/src/main/jni/lib".

# IMPORTANT - Step 4. - Set / confirm these variables before running the script
# location of the NDK 27; If you installed it via Android Studio it should be in a directory inside Android SDK location.
